    └── simple_rag.csv                         # Simple RAG evaluation metrics
```

## Usage

1. The `Hypothetical_Document_Embedding_RAG.ipynb` notebook contains the implementation of HyDE RAG with detailed annotations.
2. The `RAG_Evaluation.ipynb` notebook provides the comparative analysis between Simple RAG and HyDE RAG.
3. Performance metrics are stored in the `Results/` directory for reproducibility.
